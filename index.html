<h1>Welcome to Applism: Windows 2000 Edition!</h1>
<p>This is my website where I put document my computer-related endevours.</p>

<h2>About This Computer</h2>
<p>This website is running on an HP Compaq nc6400 laptop. The laptop 
orignally has 2G of RAM, but at some point one of the ramsticks broke, 
and now it only has 1G of working RAM. It has an Intel Centrino Duo and 
surprisingly isn't dying(yet). Similarly to the ramstick, the wifi card 
has passed on, so the laptop is permanently attached to ethernet life 
support. <br><center>o</center><br>

This laptop is running Windows 2000 Server Service Pack 4. It, despite being over 2 decades old, works 
surprisingly well. This probably has something to do with the fact that this laptop offically supports 
Windows 2000, as the drivers for it are online to download. The CPU is generally at 0% when not doing 
anything. However, surfing the web causes the CPU to spike. With that being said, it is still very usable, 
and could even be used as a daily driver, if you wanted. One thing I have yet to do is install the 
Windows 2000 Extended Kernel, which would make this laptop support newer programs (and might let me 
use discord in browser).
<br><br>
<b>UPDATE:</b> For some unknown reason, the extended kernel doesn't install properly, so no discord for 
me, sadly. However I still think this is a success, because this laptop is stable as a server, despite 
the random CPU spikes that occur.
